Design principles:

1. Support arbitrary overloading.

2. Support straightforward runtime compilation to nearly optimal code.

3. If you have to add a statement, case, etc. to get something to compile, it's bad.

4. Types should not depend on data, but they should be as flexible as possible given this restriction.

5. Containers are homogeneous.

IMPORTANT:

The type of an expression should depend only on the types of its inputs.
