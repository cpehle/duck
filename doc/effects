Notes about effects:

1.  How equivalent are uniqueness typing and monads?  In particular, what do the
    two look like when handing world state changes such as freezing/thawing
    regions of memory?

2.  We can handle imperative region effects by treating IO as "all" regions and
    adding various splitting operators that take pieces out of IO.  We'll also
    need types for "IO minus a region" for this purpose.  This all seems doable
    with the standard duck type system, since >>= can take two diferent monad
    types and produce a third.
