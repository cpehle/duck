A place for miscellaneous notes:

1. Array syntax.  Since a[i] would require whitespace-based parsing, it might be
   reasonable just to use function application syntax for array lookups.  I.e.,
   a i.  This requires overloading application, which we were already planning
   to do (and is straightforward in any case).

   If we go with array _monads_ for mutable arrays, it's possible that "a i" could
   return a helper type that would be usable for both reading and writing.  "a i"
   probably can't be a direct extraction anyways; instead, it would be a monad, and
   reading might look like

      x <- a i

   It's a fairly short leap from there to the idea that "a i" could be overloaded
   to work for reading as well.  Interestingly, the "a i" syntax might otherwise
   be unused on the left side of "<-" in "do" notation, since <- never defines
   functions.
